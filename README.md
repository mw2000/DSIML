# Introduction
This is a book designed to help in basic understanding of popular ADTs in the modern languages of Rust and Go.
With the growing importance of Go in Silicon Valley and the cult like usage of powerful, fast and safe Rust,
understanding and implementing data structures in these languages become a skill of paramount importance.
While it can be argued, that translating ADTs from C++, Java or Python code to Rust and Go is easy, we wanted to make the book in such a way that the reader learns the ADT's first in Rust and Go itself rather than C++, Java or Python.

# Motivation
Both co-authors took the class ECS 36C - Data Structures and Algorithms, at UC Davis taught by Prof. Joel Porquet. The homework assignments and engaging and exciting lectures really encouraged the co-authors to improve upon their data-structure knowledge and at the same time help people who are new to this topic. This is when they decided to write this book, to serve the following purposes
- Increase the reader's understanding in Go and Rust
- Improve the reader's application of Data Structures
- Serve as a future guilde for students studying Data Stuctures in Go and Rust
