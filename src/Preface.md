# Preface
This is a book designed to help in basic understanding of popular ADTs in the modern languages of Rust and Go.
With the growing importance of Go in Silicon Valley and the cult like usage of powerful, fast and safe Rust,
understanding and implementing data structures in these languages become a skill of paramount importance.
While it can be argued, that translating ADTs from C++, Java or Python code to Rust and Go is easy, we wanted to make the book in such a way that the reader learns the ADT's first in Rust and Go itself rather than C++, Java or Python.

We would like to thank Prof. Joel Porquet for teaching and inspiring us to write this book. Many of the above implementations of data strucutres were taught to us by him in C++. We also focus on writing clean, concise and well-linted code throughout this book, something he has inculcated in us.
